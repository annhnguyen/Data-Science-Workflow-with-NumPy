They are having a major problem with customer retention in their wireless business. In the mid-Atlantic region, 20% of cell phone customers leave when their contracts expire, and it is getting increasingly difficult to acquire new customers. Since the cell phone market is now saturated, the huge growth in the wireless market has tapered off. Communications companies are now engaged in battles to attract each other’s customers while retaining their own. Customers switching from one company to another is called churn, and it is expensive all around: one company must spend on incentives to attract a customer while another company loses revenue when the customer departs.*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *You have been called in to help understand the problem and to devise a solution. Attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones, so a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn. Marketing has already designed a special retention offer. Your task is to devise a precise, step-by-step plan for how the data science team should use MegaTelCo’s vast data resources to decide which customers should be offered the special retention deal prior to the expiration of their contracts.*"

    "_The average classification error from this homework was 4.44%. The accuracy for Lab1 would've been 91.11%, making the average classification error 8.89%. The model from this homework performed better compared to the lab and I think the performance improved because in 3.2, it said \"Create `X` and `y` arrays. Now with X including all four features.\" This makes me to believe by including all features, the model is able to capture the data and the data patterns better, decreasing error and incrdasing accuracy._"
